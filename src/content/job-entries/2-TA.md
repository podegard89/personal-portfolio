Mentored a diverse portion of students from the following free full-time remote [LaunchCode](https://launchcode.org) CodeCamps:

- **Philadelphia Immersive CodeCamp** | Oct 2022 - March 2023
- **St. Louis Community College CodeCamp** | Sept 2021 - Feb 2022
- **ComCast Grows2Code CodeCamp** | May 2021 - August 2021

Each 15-week program focused on teaching the fundamentals of full-stack web development and object-oriented programming. All courses focused on front-end technologies _HTML_, _CSS_, _JavaScript_, and _Angular_. For backend technologies, some courses focused on _C#_ and _ASP.NET Core MVC_ (Philadelphia and St. Louis), while others focused on _Java_ and _Spring_ (ComCast). This diverse mentoring experience provided valuable insights and enriched my understanding of web development, communication, and education.
